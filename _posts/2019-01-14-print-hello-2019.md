# print("Hello, 2019")

I started this blog at the beginning of 2018 (see my first post, [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-11-hello-world %})).
Seeing as we're at the beginning of 2019, it feels like a good time to reflect on the past year; my first year of blogging.

## 1) Raw summary

* Plan A: 2 posts/month
* Plan B: 1 post/month
* Reality: :-/

*Note: I never measured, but it takes me at least half a day to write a blog post. This needs to be shorten down!*

I wanted to blog more about conferences I attended (I even started to draft a post about MozFest), and to use it as an excuse to test coding libraries I'm curious about.

All in all, I'm glad I started a blog but I wish I could use it more and better in the future.

An idea was it could be useful to someone else. I feel this is not worth looking at until it has more content.

## 2) Plans for 2019

Looking ahead in 2019 I realised my excitement and priority lies in traveling and learning (sometimes combined).

A lot of my learning and traveling are tech related, so writing about those could be a good way to use my blog.

=> I will write more in 2019 than in 2018, but I will not overwhelm myself!

## 3) Upcoming posts (look at me being optimistic!)

Based on my calendar this month, here are blog posts I should be able to write:
* What's hand-drawing data viz?
* How to use Python with geo data
* Taking my front-end skills (CSS) to the next level!

Note: I've drafted this post quickly on my phone (on a plane).
In the future I'll try to draft a post quickly after an event or a learning experience. I'll also keep track of the time spent so I get better at time management in the process.
