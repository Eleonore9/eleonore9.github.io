# Visualising a data viz conference

## On OpenVisConf and sketchnoting

I recently attended [OpenVisConf](http://openvisconf.com/) (the conference for opensource data visualisation) in Paris. I was super excited as I had followed the conference from afar (it used to be in Boston) for a few years.

Another thing I'm excited about since I discovered it a little while ago is **sketchnoting**.

Sketchnoting is the process of taking visual notes. And some people use it to communicate technical information. I'm particularly inspired by my friend and badass coder/artist/sketchnoter [Malwine](https://twitter.com/malweene) who often sketchnotes tech conference talks and awesome Linux "sorceress" [Julia Evans](https://twitter.com/b0rk) who sketchnotes to share technical topics she learns about.

Since I had a conference coming up, and one about a visual subject, I thought it would be a good time to try out sketchnoting.


## How did I prepare for Sketchnoting at a conference?

I love data visualisations and maps and I'm a visual learner. I believe sharing information visually makes a lot of sense and that's definitely part of my professional goals.

This is why I (attended this conference and) want to learn to sketchnote, but behind quite impatient I wanted to do it well (enough) on my first trial. This means I would have had to prepare, by watching a conference talk video and sketchnote at home. Indeed sketchnoting live (during a talk) means you need to be fast and improvise as you don't know how much of the paper you'll need and what part of the talk to highlight.

Unfortunately I wasn't organised enough to rehearse before the conference. But I was lucky to get a sketchnoting guide zine from Malwine :)

I also had a motivating discussion with fellow Stockholm based developer friend [Mariana](https://twitter.com/MarianaBocoi) who shared her experience of starting to sketchnote at EuroClojure 2017.

Basically I needed to accept I wasn't going to do great at first, but I'd improve over time. And I shouldn't worry too much right now about the medium and pens/pencils. I should just be careful about the disposition of info and try different fonts, shapes and colours to make the content more understandable and appealing.


## How did it go??

So coming at the conference I tried to take it easy and just create a better versions of notes I would normally take. I used the notebook and pen from the conference swag bag. I stressed connections using arrows, and highlighted important things by uppercasing, underlining or drawing a shape around the words.

What happened was:

* I got disappointed and discouraged because it didn't look like what I wanted to produce
* It didn't always felt right to be taking notes. Sometimes I just wanted to listen to the talks (the amazing "Disagreements" talk by Amanda Cox and Kevin Quealy was a good example of that)
* I didn't know how to represent talks filled with so many beautiful visual elements which added to the discouragement
* I got tired

How I solved my issues:

* I missed a talk to sit down, relax and try to improve on my notes, then sent a picture to Mariana who gave me useful and very encouraging feedback :)
* I went back to the conference talks with less pressure and took notes when it felt right to do so
* I sat at home after the conference and added colours and drawings to make my notes more visual and tweeted the outcome

Here are my fave ones from what I did for OpenVisConf:

Adding small drawings was a good compromise (especially because the need to represent the visual aspects of the talk accurately faded with time).
And I got positive feedback :)

## How would I do it better next time?

### Tools
I resisted the temptation to buy more pens and I'll make do with what I have (regular blue or black writing pen and Crayola [colouring pens](http://shop.crayola.com/color-and-draw/markers/washable-super-tips-markers-10-count-5886100015.html) I had bought for lettering).

### Preparation
I'd like to think I'll prepare myself by reading the abstracts of the talks beforehand and preparing the names of speakers and talk titles in a notebook.

Unfortunately I doubt this will happen :-/

### Advice
I'm such a sketchnoting noob, but the advice I'd give someone interested is to experiment with different styles and tools to produce something you like best. I know I will experiment more from now on!

More importantly take it easy, you don't have to sketchnote all the talks but you have to have fun and enjoy the conference :)

## Conclusion
Sketchnoting is awesome! You can share your creations by posting pictures on social media and even create zines that you can print and share!! Come on, I can't be the only one excited about zines!

Also at the ["1, 2, 3 DATA" exhibition](https://123data.paris/collection) that presents all types of data visualisation projects I discovered a data visualisation zine called [Market Cafe Mag](https://twitter.com/marketcafemag)
