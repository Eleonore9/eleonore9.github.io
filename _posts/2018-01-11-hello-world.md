# Hello, world :)


I’m [Éléonore](http://elle-est-au-nord.com/)!
I’m currently a freelance developer based in Stockholm, Sweden. I’ve worked with web technologies and data science/engineering mainly using **Clojure**, **Python**, **Javascript**, **HTML** and **CSS**.


I’ve considered creating a blog for years always finding reasons (mostly lack of time) for why I wouldn't be able to sustain it with posts. But suddenly this week it made so much sense! Even if no one reads it, I now feel like a blog will be super useful for me to keep track of the things I learn over time.


I’ve actually written quite a few blog posts at my previous job where we had an internal blog to keep track of technical and business decisions and progress. And I ended up enjoying writing! The best part being when your post helps someone understand a process or problem. But memory can be faulty and having a record of previous trials and errors definitely saves time!


I have quite a few notes here and there than would be good material for the type of posts I want to write. I also plan to document the next things I’ll learn.

The themes I have in mind are: **programming languages** I know/learn (core functions and libraries), **Linux stuffs** I learn (well, Ubuntu mostly), **projects** I work on (sharing my experience and what went wrong), **geo-related things** (creating maps using open source software, contributing to humanitarian mapping) and maybe **exploring (digital) art**.


*Disclaimer*: I’m not a native English speaker so you might have to suffer terrible grammatical errors (hopefully not spelling ones except for the odd typo).
